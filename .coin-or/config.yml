  ShortDescription: A library of cutting-plane generators.
  LongDescription: |2
    "The COIN-OR Cut Generation Library (Cgl) is an open collection
    of cutting plane implementations (\"cut generators\") for use in
    teaching, research, and applications. Cgl can be used with other
    COIN-OR packages that make use of cuts, such as the mixed-integer
    linear programming solver Cbc. Each cut generator has its own
    maintainer who leads the development of its functionality, testing,
    and documentation. See below for a listing of available generators.
    All the generators are combined in one library when Cgl is compiled."
