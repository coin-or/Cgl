CUT GENERATION LIBRARY INSTALLATION
===================================

The instruction in this file are useful only if you downloaded the
Cgl package. If you dowloaded another package, Cgl should be installed
as part of that package. See the INSTALL file in the main directory
of the package.

In this document, the following names are used:

1. 'coin-Cgl' is the full path to the directory in which you have 
   dowloaded Cgl.

2. 'build' is the full path to the directory used for the installation 
   of Cgl. It might be coin-Cgl or any other directory of your choosing.


OVERVIEW
========

More information, including current stable version number and current release
number, is available on the Cut Generation Library (Cgl)
Trac page at:

   https://projects.coin-or.org/Cgl

The instructions below are for UNIX-like systems (including Linux, Cygwin
and MSys) only. If Microsoft Developer Studio projects are
maintained for this package, you can find instructions at

  https://projects.coin-or.org/MSVisualStudio

For other systems or for more information about dowloading and installing
go to:

DOWNLOADING CGL
===============

You can obtain the source code for the Cgl package as follow:

   Download the most recent tarball from 
   http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cgl. Its name should be
   Cgl-x.y.x.tgz where x, y, and z are three numbers.

   Extract the code, for example, with

   gunzip Cgl-x.y.z.tgz
   tar xvf Cgl-x.y.z.tar

   (Here "x.y.z" is of course replaced by the string in the
   tarball you downloaded.)

   To match the description in the remainder of this installation file,
   rename the directory "Cgl-x.y" to "coin-Cgl" using

   mv Cgl-x.y coin-Cgl


More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp



CONFIGURATION OF CGL
====================

Go into the directory 'build' where you want to install Cgl.  There, type

   coin-Cgl/configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp

and the Cgl Trac page for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Cgl successful"


COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION
============================

In the directory 'build':

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, type (this is optional)

   make test

   The typical output of the test is available from the Cgl Trac page.

3. To install the code, type

   make install

   The executables are installed in build/bin, the libraries in
   build/lib and the header files in build/include.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found on 
the Cgl Trac page and at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp


DOCUMENTATION
=============

If you have Doxygen available, you can create the html documentation 
by typing

   make doxydoc

in the directory 'build'. Then open the file 

   coin-Cgl/doxydoc/html/index.html 

with a browser. Note that this creates the documentation for all the
projects in the package. If you prefer to generate the documentation 
only for a subset of these projects, you can edit the file 
  
   coin-Cgl/doxydoc/doxygen.conf 

to exclude directories (using the EXCLUDE variable, for example).

If Doxygen is not available, the html documentation is available at:

   http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cgl


USING THE LIBRARIES
===================

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples in the

   coin-Cgl/Cgl/examples/

subdirectory, see also the information at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp
